In order to use the **test error** of a **test set** as an approximation of the **generalization error**, we need to effectively split the initial data set into mutually exclusive **training sets** and **test sets**. The following are some common methods.

## Hold-out

The data set $D$ is divided into two mutually exclusive sets, one as the training set $S$ and one as the test set $T$, satisfying $D=S\cupT$ and $S\capT=\phi$. The common division is about 2/3-4/5 samples are used for training and the rest for testing. 

It is important to note that the division of the training/test sets should be as consistent as possible in the distribution of the data to avoid additional bias, and the stratified sampling is commonly used.

At the same time, the results of the single hold-out are often not stable enough due to the random nature of the division, and generally we take the average of a number of random division repeated experiments.
