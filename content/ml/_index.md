Machine learning is one of the most exciting directions in information technology today, and its application has penetrated into all aspects of life and is closely related to the daily lives of ordinary people.

The *Machine Learning* textbook from Tsinghua University, written by Professor *Zhou Zhihua* of Nanjing University, also known as the Watermelon Book, is a comprehensive book that introduces different types of algorithms in machine learning (e.g. supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, reinforcement learning, integrated downscaling, feature selection, etc.)

This documents is a Learning Note for *Machine Learning*, a record of my understanding and expanding knowledge points during the learning process, and a tribute to predecessors and knowledge.
